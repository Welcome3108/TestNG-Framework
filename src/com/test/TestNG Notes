-->TesNG:-unit Test Framework
-->TDD:-Test Driven Development

-->Unit Testing:- Developer break the complete application code into smaller units and test all the units separately. 
              This process of breaking the code into smaller units and testing is known as Unit Testing. 
              Unit Testing can be performed in both manual and by automation.
              
-->Purpose of TestNG:-To design a Test Cases in a Systematic Way.
                      Generates HTML reports
                      Different annotation
                      Priority/sequence to execute a different Test Cases.
                      Dependency:if one test case dependent upon another.
                      Grouping
                      data provider

-->TestNG:-Open source,Free

-->TestNG is also called as Java Unit Testing Framework.

-->In TestNG we do not write main method.

-->Every annotation should associate with method.(It means one annotation should link with one method).
 	
-->Annotation Starting @Before is called as a Pre-requiste or Pre-condition Annotation. 

-->Annotation Starting @Test is Called as Test Case.

-->Once the Test Case is completed what you want to perform is done by @After Annoatation.

-->We set the priority of the Test Cases by mentiong the priority in front of @Test annotation.
   Ex:- @Test((Priority=1)

-->We can create the Groups according to method Name.
   Ex:- @Test(Priority=1,groups="LinkTest")
   
-->If one Test case is depend upon another Test Cases
   Ex:-@Test
        public void loginTest(){
        System.out.println("Login Test");
        }
        
        @Test(dependsOnMethods="loginTest")
        public void homeoageTest(){
        System.out.println("Home pAge Test");
        }
        
-->If we want to excute the sameTest cases we use:Invocationcount 

-->If Test Case goes into infinite loop use timeOut Keywords:@Test(timeOut=3000).

-->We can convert number into String by using expectedException=NumberFormatException.class

-->To validate the Data we use assertation(Ex:-assert)

-->To validate we use Assert.assertEquals(actual,Expected);

-->If condition is true Assert.assertTrue();

-->TestNG.xml:-It is XML file which take a control how you want to excute yur Test Case at a time.

-->If you get TestNG Test it will run one single class.

-->But if you get TestNG suite it will run multiple program.

-->TestNg is also called as TestNG Template file or Runner File.

-->DataDriven from Different Resource:-
    a.Excel File
    b.Properties file :-Env variable OR Test Data
    c.Testing.xml:- Env variable
    d.XML file
    e.JASON files
    f.DB
